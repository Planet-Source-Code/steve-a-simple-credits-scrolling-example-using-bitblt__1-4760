## A simple credits scrolling example using BitBlt


</div>

### Description

I was recieving several requests after recently making a post concerning a scrolling credits examples, simply saying that I had something similiar that worked in most aspects slightly better, because it used BitBlt and read the credits directly from a text file. I got quite a few emails requesting I send them it, so I just decided to post it to this site. Hope everyone likes it, if not sorry.
