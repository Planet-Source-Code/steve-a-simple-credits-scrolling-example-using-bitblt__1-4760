This is a scrolling Credits Example.
The number of the first line tells the
program how many lines of text are located
in the file.  So change it to match 
accordingly.  Other than that, just add
the form I included and a text file in 
the applications folder named credits, 
and it will scroll it, without flickering, 
and with a shadow to give it a 3d effect.

Tell me what you think
